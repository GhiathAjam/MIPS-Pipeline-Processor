- INT idx
 1- idx is passed as immediate
 2- alu passes imm as alu res
 3- EDU knows it is interrupt from mem-address mux
 4- EDU enters a procedure of multiple cycles:
  4.0- EDU signals storing next PC to the stack
  4.1- EDU passes 6 to mem address to get address of IVT
  4.2- EDU passes IVT address again to memory after adding alu res to it
  4.3- mem res is sent to pc

- all readings except buffers and registers are combinational
- PC  register updates on falling edge (or later if needed)
- buffers update on falling edge (or later if needed)
- alu is combinational
- stack pointer is updated AFTER operation


- MEMORY notes:
 - writing to memory, stack or port is done with falling edge

- BUFFERS notes:
  - writing is done with falling edge

Exceptions:
  1- pop when empty stack
  2- alu res > 0xFF00
